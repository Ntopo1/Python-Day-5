<h1> Python: 100 Days of Coding Challenge: Day 5</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Today I learned about Loops, Range, and Code Blocks. I will write a password generator at the end of today to reinforce these new tools.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 1:</h3>
<p>For Loop: Write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights:</p> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> Calcualting the toal_height using a for loop is similar to the sum() funtion. Using a for loop to calculate the total_students functions the same a s the len() function. We were asked to not use sum(), or len() in this task.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 2:</h3> 
<p>Write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores, without using max().</p> 
<br /> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> This for loop tracks the highest number in the list using an if statement to calculate the greatest number.</p> 
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
<p> Write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X.</p> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 4:</h3> 
<p> Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:

    Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include the number 100.

    When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

    When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

    And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> I was not familiar with this game but I could see it getting hectic with a large group of people. The program makes it much easier.</p> 
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 5:</h3>
Create a password generator </p>

</p>
<p align="left">This ended up being fairly tricky. I learned how to convert strings into lists and back. Even though it may not be a long piece of code, I can already see a lot of benefits of using programming tools like this. The code might not be secure because it doesn't check for input validation. But I will ensure to implement them in the future once I have a better grasp of the fundamentals.</p>
<p >That took me quite a while to research on random.choice and random.shuffle and how to implement them correctly. But it's extremely satisfying to see the code finally work properly. That's all for Day 5!</p>
